# Bikesharing

## Overview
Utilizing results from New York City’s Citi bike sharing program data from 2019, we are investigating whether the similar concept of a bike company would be feasible to implement in the city of Des Moines, Iowa. While both cities are distinct in terms of geographical locations and features, comparing the participation of the bike sharing program can assist in proving if a company to establish a similar program could be equally as fruitful in Iowa. There are already angel investors inquiring about the business proposition and are intrigued to see an analysis of the results. 

The data used for this analysis derives from information collected from August 2019, in which August represents the summer month with the busiest traffic. Essentially, through the use of Tableau, we have created a variety of charts and graphs to better understand not only how the business actually works in NYC, but analyze the participation to create a proposal as to how the bike-sharing program may work in Des Moines. 

## Tech Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Tableau

## Dataset:
- Citi Bike System August 2019 Data

## Objectives: 
- Import data into Tableau.
- Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
- Use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.
- Portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.

## Results
Keeping in mind that Des Moines and New York City are two different makeups of cities, the information collected from New York City’s bike sharing participation can shed some light as to the breakdown of individuals who are more inclined to use a bike-sharing program.
