# Bikesharing

## Overview
Utilizing results from New York City’s Citi bike sharing program data from 2019, we are investigating whether the similar concept of a bike company would be feasible to implement in the city of Des Moines, Iowa. While both cities are distinct in terms of geographical locations and features, comparing the participation of the bike sharing program can assist in proving if a company to establish a similar program could be equally as fruitful in Iowa. There are already angel investors inquiring about the business proposition and are intrigued to see an analysis of the results. 

The data used for this analysis derives from information collected from August 2019, in which August represents the summer month with the busiest traffic. Essentially, through the use of Tableau, we have created a variety of charts and graphs to better understand not only how the business actually works in NYC, but analyze the participation to create a proposal as to how the bike-sharing program may work in Des Moines. 

## Tech Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Tableau

## Dataset:
- Citi Bike System August 2019 Data

## Objectives: 
- Import data into Tableau.
- Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
- Use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.
- Portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.

## Results
Keeping in mind that Des Moines and New York City are two different makeups of cities, the information collected from New York City’s bike sharing participation can shed some light as to the breakdown of individuals who are more inclined to use a bike-sharing program.

Understanding when and where people use Citi Bike will help to determine where to best pilot the program in Des Moines. The above symbol map depicts the most popular locations in the city for starting a bike journey. The larger and darker shade of green on the map signifies the most popular stations that bike riders are more inclined to start at. Viewing the location of popularity, we can tell it is in the central hub of the city.

While we know that the data compromises of 2,344, 224 total number of trips, we want to see a breakdown by gender of who and how many are taking the trips in the program. We can see that about 1 million more males participate in the program more than females, with a small portion of the users are categorized as ‘unknown’.

As we break down the data further, we want to further view how the user type of Citi Bike is organized. Through the pie chart, we can see that annual subscribers far outpace the customer group (these individuals who only hold a 24-hour pass or a 3-day pass user). Preference wise, users are more inclined to hold an annual pass for the use of the bike rather than purchase the program type for a few day time frame, expressing a desire of a longer term commitment with the program rather than having a a few days access.

As we understand the sub groups who participate in the program, we move on to understanding the length of times that bikes are checked out. Viewing the line chart, we see that having the bike checked out for not even an hour is a popular choice, roughly 146k of rides have bikes checked out for about 5 minutes. Showing that in the city with shorter distances, the most favorite way to get across is by bike.
